# 🧠 WebOS - Simulated Operating System in the Browser

A fully functional, **browser-based operating system simulation** built with **React**, **Zustand**, **GSAP**, and a custom-made **kernel architecture**. This isn’t just a styled window manager — it mimics how real operating systems manage memory, processes, storage, and scheduling.  

Designed to help students **visualize OS internals**, explore resource constraints, and run multitasking apps inside a fully interactive system — right from their browser.

## ⚡ Key Features

- 🚀 **Real-Time Process Simulation**  
  Launch multiple apps in parallel with individual CPU + memory consumption.

- 🧠 **Simulated Kernel**  
  Core modules handle scheduling, memory, file I/O, and process lifecycle — all with resource logic and constraints.

- 📊 **Live System Stats**  
  Hidden developer panel reveals active processes, memory map, CPU usage, and app status in real-time.

- 🪟 **Windowing System**  
  Built using `react-rnd`, it supports dragging, resizing, minimizing, maximizing, and z-index focus — all animated with GSAP.

- 🧩 **Fully Modular Architecture**  
  Everything is split into modules with shared access through a global `kernelContext` for clean control.

- 🔧 **Error Handling for CPU/Memory Overload**  
  Realistic constraints simulate real OS behavior under heavy load.

## 🧠 Simulated Kernel Modules

### 📦 MemoryManager
- Implements **First-Fit Allocation**
- Handles **Fragmentation Tracking**
- Allocates and frees memory blocks dynamically based on process requirements

### ⏱️ Scheduler
- Implements **Round Robin CPU Scheduling**
- Allocates CPU time in cycles (quanta)
- Simulates CPU overload and decay (usage drops over time if idle)

### 💾 StorageSystem
- **Block-Based Storage Architecture**
- Manages raw storage blocks and interfaces with file system for low-level I/O
- Mimics real-world disk layout principles

### 📁 FileSystem
- Implements **Nested Hierarchical File Structure**
- Supports folders, files, and nested traversal
- File operations are backed by simulated block-level storage

### 🧩 ProcessManager
- Creates, terminates, and tracks all app processes
- Coordinates with memory and scheduler to maintain process states (`ready`, `running`, `waiting`)

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> “OS dev isn’t about the GUI — it’s about the guts.”  

Unlike basic to-do apps or dashboards, this project replicates the **under-the-hood systems** that power modern computing — but does so visually and interactively.  

It teaches by simulation.  
It scales by architecture.  
It impresses by depth.
