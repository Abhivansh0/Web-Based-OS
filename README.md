# 🧠 WebOS - Simulated Operating System in the Browser

## _A futuristic, research-grade OS… built with frontend tools. Because why not?_

WebOS is a full operating system simulation implemented entirely in the browser.
It models fundamental OS subsystems — process management, memory allocation, CPU scheduling, file systems, and storage — built using React, Zustand, GSAP, and a custom kernel architecture.
This project is designed to bridge theory and practice, allowing students and developers to observe how low-level mechanisms behave under realistic constraints. The architecture models core OS principles such as:

* Round Robin scheduling
* First-Fit memory allocation
* Fragmentation handling
* Block-based disk storage
* Hierarchical file system traversal
* Kernel-led resource arbitration

All system interactions occur through a **kernel-first control flow**, ensuring strict separation of the computational model and UI rendering.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project is architected into three distinct layers to mimic real-world OS design. The **Zustand Store** acts as an "Authoritative Cache," synchronizing the high-speed UI with the low-level Kernel logic.
* WebOS is built on a Kernel → Store → UI pipeline.
* The UI is NEVER allowed to guess system state.
* Everything goes through the kernel first.

Below is the entire system in one diagram — the brain of WebOS:

## ⚙️ Technical Deep Dive

### 1. The Custom Kernel

#### 📦 MemoryManager
- Implements **First-Fit Allocation**
- Handles **Fragmentation Tracking**
- Allocates and frees memory blocks dynamically based on process requirements

#### ⏱️ Scheduler
- Implements **Round Robin CPU Scheduling**
- Allocates CPU time in cycles (quanta)
- Simulates CPU overload and decay (usage drops over time if idle)

#### 💾 StorageSystem
- Implements a **Block-Based Virtual Disk**
- Disk is divided into fixed-size blocks
- Handles raw block allocation and deallocation
- Maintains no concept of files, paths, or directories
- Exposes low-level storage primitives to the File System

#### 📁 FileSystem (Inode-Based)
- Implements a **Unix-inspired inode file system**
- File identity is represented by **inode IDs**, not paths
- Each inode stores:
  - type (`file` / `directory`)
  - size (authoritative logical file length)
  - list of allocated disk blocks
- Directories store **directory entries** (`name → inodeId`)
- Supports:
  - hierarchical directory traversal
  - block-based file growth and shrink
  - recursive directory deletion
  - rename and move via directory relinking (no data copying)
- Enforces strict file semantics:
  - no sparse files
  - writes allowed only at or before EOF
  - `inode.size` defines the visible file boundary

#### 🧩 ProcessManager
- Creates, terminates, and tracks all app processes
- Coordinates with memory and scheduler to maintain process states (`ready`, `running`, `waiting`)


### 2. The Rendering Engine (Registry Pattern)

- **App Registry:** Maps app identifiers (“Terminal”, “Calculator”) to React components.
  
- **Window Factory:** App loop listens to `windowStore` and mounts apps dynamically.
  
- **The Wrapper (`AppWindow`):** The resolved component is injected into a generic `<AppWindow />` wrapper. This wrapper handles all the "OS-level" behavior—dragging, resizing (via `react-rnd`), closing, and minimizing—while the app component inside remains purely functional and isolated.


### 3. System Resilience & Error Simulation

Unlike standard web apps that have infinite virtual memory, WebOS enforces strict, realistic resource constraints managed by the Kernel. The system implements a robust error-handling pipeline:

- 🔥 **CPU Overload:** If the total CPU usage of active processes approaches 100%, the Scheduler throttles new process creation and the Kernel throws a CPU_OVERLOAD error, preventing system instability.
  
- 🧠 **Out of Memory (OOM):** The Memory Manager tracks available blocks. If an app requests more memory than available (fragmentation or full usage), the Kernel denies the PID allocation, triggering an OOM Crash simulation in the UI.
  
- 💾 **Out of Storage:** The File System calculates block usage on the virtual disk. Attempting to save a file when blocks are full triggers a write failure, requiring the user to delete files to free up space.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> “OS dev isn’t about the GUI — it’s about the guts.”  

WebOS is one of the few browser-based projects that simulates actual OS behavior, not just the appearance of one.

It teaches by simulation.  
It scales by architecture.  
It impresses by depth.
